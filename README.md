# Discord-Shell-POC
A script that can allow you to get remote access to a machine on Discord via them putting code in the console. Also allows you to crash the BetterDiscord client. I'm planning to add more connection methods along with a way to put this code in a BetterDiscord plugin so it can be more efficient.
Shout out to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgBPo5i0T9Q&ab_channel=HellSec] for giving me the idea to make this!

# How to use
```
python main.py
```
# How to crash BetterDiscord
```
py main.py
select the second option
once you are connected to the victims machine from another computer (or your own if you are simply testing)
type in the command 'exit'
The BetterDiscord client should crash and you should be instantly logged out of your account.
```
